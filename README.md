# 🚀 Aerospace CFD & Propulsion Learning Journey

Hello! I am Elie Moussa, a Mechanical Engineering master's student passionate about **Aerospace simulation, CFD, and propulsion systems**.  
I'm currently transitioning into the aerospace field and documenting my **12-month learning journey** toward becoming a simulation and propulsion engineer.

This repository will serve as my **open portfolio**, where I’ll upload:

- Learning notes and resources.  
- Code, scripts, and simulation files (OpenFOAM, Python, Fluent)  
- Final project reports with visuals and validation comparisons  

---

## 🎯 My Mission
To develop a strong foundation in **CFD, rocket propulsion, and simulation workflows** using both open-source and industry tools — and to share my progress publicly so others can learn along with me.

---

## 🧱 Upcoming Learning Plan (2025–2026)

| Phase | Focus | Expected Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| **Foundation (Months 1–3)** | CFD basics, FVM, Python scripting, OpenFOAM setup | Notes, small CFD tutorial cases |
| **Applied CFD (Months 4–6)** | Airfoil simulations, meshing, validation | 2D airfoil CFD project |
| **Propulsion & Compressible Flow (Months 7–9)** | Nozzle & plume flow, rocket thermodynamics | 1D rocket cycle solver, nozzle CFD |
| **Advanced & Automation (Months 10–12)** | Transonic flows, HPC, automation | Capstone CFD project (rocket plume) |

## 🧰 Tools I’m Learning

- **Simulation:** OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, ParaView  
- **Programming:** Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), Bash, Git, C++
- **Engineering:** Rocket propulsion, compressible flow, turbulence modeling, thermodynamics  
- **Workflow:** Linux environment, GitHub version control, basic HPC (parallel OpenFOAM jobs)
