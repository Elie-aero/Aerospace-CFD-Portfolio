# 🚀 Aerospace CFD & Propulsion Learning Journey

Hello! I’m **Elie Moussa**, a Mechanical Engineering master’s student focused on **aerospace simulation, propulsion, and controls**.
This repository is my **public portfolio** for projects built around:

- **MATLAB & Simulink** – modelling dynamic systems, control, and data analysis  
- **ANSYS Fluent** – CFD for airfoils, nozzles, and propulsion-related flows  
- **Python & Machine Learning** – automation, data processing, and surrogate models for simulation

---

## 🎯 Mission

Build a strong, *industry-relevant* skill set in **aerospace propulsion and simulation** using  
**MATLAB/Simulink, ANSYS Fluent, and Python/ML**, and document everything in a clean, reproducible way.

## 🛠 Skills & Tools

**Simulation & CFD**
- ANSYS Fluent  
- Basic mesh setup and post-processing for external and internal aerodynamics  
- Nozzle and basic propulsion-related flow cases

**MATLAB & Simulink**
- MATLAB scripting for engineering calculations and data analysis  
- Simulink models of dynamic systems (actuators, simple propulsion/control blocks)  
- Plotting, parameter sweeps, and result post-processing

**Python & Machine Learning**
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib)  
- Basic machine learning (scikit-learn): regression & classification  
- Training simple surrogate models on CFD or simulation data (e.g. predicting Cl/Cd, nozzle performance)

**Aerospace / Propulsion Concepts**
- Compressible flow (Mach number, shock & expansion basics)  
- Airfoil aerodynamics and performance metrics  
- Intro rocket/nozzle propulsion performance (thrust, Isp, mass flow)
